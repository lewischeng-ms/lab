##Discussion
You can participate into discussions and ask questions at our [Github issues](https://github.com/OData/lab/issues). 

##Pull requests
Pull request of features and bug fixes are both welcomed. Before you send a pull request to us, there are a few steps you need to make sure you've followed. 
###Complete a Contribution License Agreement (CLA)
You will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.

Please submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting a pull request. Download the agreement ([Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.pdf](https://github.com/odata/odatacpp/wiki/files/Microsoft Contribution License Agreement.pdf)), sign, scan, and email it back to [cla@microsoft.com](mailto:cla@microsoft.com). Be sure to include your Github user name along with the agreement. Only after we have received the signed CLA, we'll review the pull request that you send. You only need to do this once for contributing to any Microsoft open source projects. 

###Create a new issue on the issue tracker and link the pull request to it
You should have an issue created on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OData/lab/issues) before you work on the pull request.
